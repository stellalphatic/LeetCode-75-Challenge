//Input: candies = [2,3,5,1,3], extraCandies = 3
//Output: [true,true,true,false,true] 
//Explanation: If you give all extraCandies to:
//- Kid 1, they will have 2 + 3 = 5 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
//- Kid 2, they will have 3 + 3 = 6 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
//- Kid 3, they will have 5 + 3 = 8 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
//- Kid 4, they will have 1 + 3 = 4 candies, which is not the greatest among the kids.
//- Kid 5, they will have 3 + 3 = 6 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
